# express-static-boilerplate

Just a simple `express.js` boilerplate here. Designed to serve static content from the `public` directory, and that's about it! Some sensible middlewares are also included and enabled by default, to get you started quickly with single-page app development or whatever.

How to get started:

1. Clone it
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` OR start the server with a long-running daemon like `supervisor` or `nodemon`
4. Rejoice!
